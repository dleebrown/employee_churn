# Employee Retention/Churn Analysis - Donald Lee-Brown

Originally a mock data challenge completed as part of the [2018B NYC Insight Data Science Fellows Program](https://www.insightdatascience.com/).

Employee churn is a major cost driver at many companies, as the cost of re-hiring and training a new employee can in many cases be higher than the employee's annual salary. Thus, if employee churn can be predicted, companies can either a) better budget for re-hiring expenses and/or b) reduce the impact of the factors that make an employee leave their job.

In this project we are presented with some limited data on employees from several companies. The data include information about the employee's tenure at the company (hire date and leave date), position, salary, and years of experience prior to being hired at the company. The data span the years 2011-2015.

Key questions to answer are:

* What are some key individual factors that influence employee churn? For example, salary, discipline, and experience may all play a role in whether or not a company retains an employee.

* Do company-wide factors play a role in employee churn? For example, perhaps employees at large companies are more likely to leave and pursue other opportunies (or vice versa).

* When does churn occur? Do most dissatisfied employees leave early or do they try and stick around for a few years?
